## Software Engineering Experience

Some recent experiences with software engineering I have been lucky to have:

1. San Diego Supercomputer Center (UCSD)
2. IBM Accelerate
3. Yonder Dynamics

### San Diego Supercomputer Center 

A couple years ago, I had the opportunity to work as a research intern at the [San Diego Supercomputer Center](https://www.sdsc.edu/) (SDSC) located in UC San Diego during the summer. As part of a research program, I designed my own bioinformatics research project under the supervision of two research scientists at SDSC. I researched about detecting metabolite biomarkers of Parkinson's Disease and gathered hundreds of molecular descriptor data points on potential biomarkers. To accomplish this, I developed multiple Python scripts to query, preprocess, and format my data and trained a multilayer perceptron on this data to detect patterns in the molecular descriptors of metabolites that were found to have a significant change in concentration in Parkinson's Disease patients compared to healthy controls. At the end of the program, I presented my findings and the results of my projects with other students and faculty members in the program.

### IBM Accelerate Software Developer

A year ago, I participated in the software track of the [IBM Accelerate](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/jobs/career-ready-skills-with-ibm-accelerate-summer-program/) developmental program hosted by IBM. As a software track student, I participated in weekly trainings that exposed me to the fundamentals of web development. Throughout the eight weeks, I learned about the basics of front-end development, back-end development, event handling, web application security, cloud native development and participated in hands-on "labs" to practice these new skills. Over the course of all the labs, I developed a personal website using React.js, HTML, CSS for the front-end and Node.js/Express.js for the back-end.

### Yonder Dynamics

Currently, I am a software team member of the robotics organization [Yonder Dynamics](https://yonderdynamics.org/#/) in UCSD. The Yonder Dynamics team builds a rover to compete in the annual University Rover Challenge with teams across the world. During my time at Yonder Dynamics, I have had the opportunity to learn systems programming to program Raspberry Pi and Arduino microcontrollers to control various mechanisms of the rover. Recently, I have worked on designing a new state machine for the autonomous mission of the competition and implementing the new state machine using the ROS framework in Python. 

> The University Rover Challenge (URC) is the world's premier robotics competition for college students.  Held annually in the desert of southern Utah in the United States, URC challenges student teams to design and build the next generation of Mars rovers that will one day work alongside astronauts exploring the Red Planet.
