## My Early History with Computer Science and Programming

I picked up an interest in programming and computer science ever since I joined my middle school's FLL robotics team, where I would use block programming to program our mini robot to complete various missions. However, my interest was really piqued when I joined my high school's FRC robotics team and was introduced to entirely new topics like object-oriented programming and command based programming. I quickly realized that I loved the problem solving aspect of programming and in some ways, it felt like solving a puzzle while also being given freedom in my approach to solving the puzzle. I ended up taking a couple of computer science courses at my high school, which only bolstered my interest in computer science and programming as a future career.
